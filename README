Subwoofer simulator plugin for Audacious

Copyright 2012 Janne Kulmala <janne.t.kulmala@iki.fi>
Based on XMMS/Audacious echo plugin by Johan Levin 1999.

This plugin is designed to improve the poor bass reproduction of heap 
and low-quality head phones by boosting the thumps. It does this by 
extracting the low frequencies using a low pass filter and using a 
combination of delay buffer and feedback. The delay and the feedback are 
used to simulate the bouncing of the sound pressure produced by a large 
subwoofer in a (small) room. For example, a wall 5 meters away causes an 
echo 30 ms later, which in turn causes a weaker echo again 30 ms later, 
and so on.

The audio flow is as follows:

(input)--->-----+----->(passthrough volume)------->(+)--->(output)
                |                                   |
               (+)<-------(feedback amount)<--------|
                |                                   |
                '--->(delay)-->(lowpass filter)---->'
